E         F         F           F         F       E      F    G      F
We were both young when I first saw you

F      E      F       F      F       F       E - F           G
I close my eyes and the flashback starts

F        E - F          D
I'm standing there

F   F   F - E - E   C    C - C    D
On a balcony in summer air

 

E        F         F         F    F     E - F
See the lights, see the party

F        G         F
The ball gowns

E         F        F          F        F           E            F        G
See you make your way through the crowd

F        E      F-D
And say hello

 

F - E     C   C    D
Little did I know

F           E       F       F-F-F
That you were Romeo

F           F          E - F          G - F
You were throwing pebbles

F        F      F - F     G
And my daddy said

F          F - F     F     ^C-Bb-A
"Stay away from Juliet"

 

G     A     G     A - G   A    A      A - F
And I was crying on the staircase

G  -  G       G          G         F        A-Bb-A
Begging you, please, don't go   ~

 

A     A    F      F-F-Bb
And I said "Romeo

A         F        F  -  G          G      F    A     F-G
Take me somewhere we can be alone

F    G    A - G
I'll be waiting

F        G       G     F   A   F   G
All that's left to do is run

 

F           G     F       A
You'll be the prince

G        F   G    F      A - G
And I'll be the princess

F    F   G     A-G-A-G
It's a love story   ~

A-G     A    A-G   F
Baby just say yes"
